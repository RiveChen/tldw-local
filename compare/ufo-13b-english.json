                    "answer": " Lt. Ryan Graves begins by introducing himself as an F/A-18 Super Hornet pilot with over 3,500 hours of flight experience. He served in the US Navy for nine years before retiring in 2017. During his service, he was stationed at NAS Lemoore, CA, where he flew with VFA-106 \"Gladiators\" from 2004 to 2009.\n\nHe then describes an incident that occurred during one of their training missions near San Diego, California, involving a Tic Tac-shaped object moving at high speed and performing maneuvers far beyond what any known aircraft could do. The object rapidly accelerated in front of them and disappeared within seconds. This event lasted around half a mile but left no physical evidence behind.\n\nLt. Graves mentions that they immediately turned back to see where the whitewater (the ocean's surface) was located after losing contact with it, only to find out that it had also vanished along with the mysterious object. They returned to base and shared their encounter with other pilots who were getting ready to launch, including Alex Detrick - another witness present today.\n\nAfter returning home, Lt. Graves learned about Jay Stratton through social media connections; Mr. Stratton is part of ATIP program led by Lou Elizondo in Pentagon. In 2009, Lt. Graves received information regarding active jamming on APG-73 radar systems caused by the UAP he encountered earlier. However, this information has never been released publicly or investigated further.\n\nIn 2017, when Tom DeLonge formed To The Stars Academy alongside former government officials like Louis Elizondo, Chris Mellon, Steve Justice, Helene Cooper, Rob Blumenthal, and Leslie Kean, Lt. Graves decided to come forward as one of the first military whistleblowers speaking openly about his experience with unidentified aerial phenomena (UAP). This decision came after being approached by both Mr. Elizondo and Tom DeLonge separately.\n\nSince then, more witnesses have come forward sharing similar experiences involving advanced technology not from Earth that defies our current understanding of physics and engineering principles. These testimonies highlight the need for oversight over any work done using taxpayer funds related to these mysterious crafts - even if they are classified under an \"unacknowledged wave\" program within the US Government.\n\nFinally, Lt. Graves emphasizes the importance of ensuring proper checks and balances in place across all government programs dealing with extraterrestrial life forms or technologies so that elected representatives can adequately serve their constituents' interests while protecting national security concerns at the same time."

However, they argue that the objects themselves should not be classified.\n\nThe witnesses were then asked if there was any reason why anything related to UAP from 15 years ago should not be immediately made public. They responded that unless it shows a specific national security vulnerability as it relates to a weakness in particular defenses, there is no reason why such information should not be made public.\n\nNext, the witnesses discussed an incident involving a TikTok-shaped object encountered by Mr. Fraver in 2004. He stated that after the incident, he was debriefed but no one else talked to him about it. The captain and admiral were aware but took no action.\n\nMr. Fraver was then asked if this was the only UAP event he encountered while a pilot. He confirmed that it was.\n\nWhen asked if they believe UAPs pose a potential threat to national security, all three witnesses answered yes. They explained that the technology they faced was far superior to anything they had and could be placed anywhere, potentially posing a significant threat if captured, reverse engineered, and used against us.\n\nFinally, the witnesses emphasized the importance of identifying friend from foe in both commercial and military aviation and how ignoring unidentified targets due to fear or stigma can lead to uncertainty in our operating space."

Lack of centralized reporting system for UAP encounters - All three witnesses agreed that there needs to be a location where information is centralized for processing and a two-way communication loop between operators and intelligence professionals. Currently, there isn't much back and forth between them.\n2. Information being hidden from public view - Mr. Grush claimed that he believes some information is being hidden, such as material acquisition and exploitation activity, baselining the UAPs but not sharing it with intelligence professionals who are actually doing step briefs to pilots. He also mentioned that both classified and unclassified information should be shared with the public.\n3. Stigma around pilot reporting of UAPs - Pilot Christopher Mellon expressed concern about the stigma surrounding pilots reporting UAPs, which could prevent accurate data collection on these mysterious objects. He stated that many more pilots have had encounters than just those currently working with him, and they need an official reporting system to share their experiences without fear of retaliation or ridicule.\n4. Coastal radars can track UAPs - Former Navy Commander David Fravor suggested using coastal radars to monitor our air defense identification zone (ADIZ) and pull maneuvering data when UAPs are detected. This would provide additional information beyond what individual aircraft can gather alone.\n5. Need for a centralized repository for reports - All three witnesses agreed that there needs to be a centrally located repository where all UAP-related reports go so that they can be analyzed together instead of scattered across various departments within DOD."

The purpose of the hearing is to better understand how pilots interact with UAPs and what steps should be taken for national security purposes.\n\nThe first witness, Mr. Fravor, explains his encounter with a Tic-Tac shaped object while flying an F/A-18 fighter jet off the coast of San Diego in 2004. He describes seeing the object hovering at around 35,000 feet before descending rapidly towards him. When he got closer, he noticed no visible engines or exhaust plumes but could see details such as windows and portholes. After circling the object several times, they lost visual contact due to cloud cover.\n\nMr. Graves then shares his experience from 2019 when he was flying over New Jersey on a commercial airliner. He saw two bright lights moving erratically near each other, which eventually merged into one larger light that followed them for about 10 minutes before disappearing suddenly. This event lasted approximately 2 hours and involved multiple aircraft including military jets trying to intercept it without success.\n\nMrs. Bigelow discusses her work on developing advanced materials and sensors used by NASA's space program. She states that there is evidence suggesting some UAPs may have originated from Earth rather than extraterrestrial sources, citing examples like balloons or drones being mistaken for alien craft. However, she also acknowledges that many cases remain unexplained and more research needs to be done.\n\nFinally, Mr. Grush raises concerns about information being hidden within the intelligence community regarding UAP encounters. He believes this lack of transparency hinders efforts towards understanding these phenomena better and potentially poses national security risks if adversaries take advantage of any gaps in our knowledge. To address these issues, he recommends centralizing location where all relevant data can be processed efficiently and establishing a two-way communication loop between operators at the front end and experts who provide feedback and best practices."

Mr. Graves explains that he is currently working with 30 pilots who have had such encounters, but he also knows of many more pilots who have experienced them. He further elaborates that since 2014, when they first started seeing these objects off the Eastern Seaboard, many other military aviators have continued to experience them up until recently.\n\nCongressman Garcia then asks both Mr. Graves and Mr. Fraver if not having a system for reporting UAPs is harmful to national security interests and understanding the phenomenon of what's happening with UAPs. Both men agree that it is a travesty and a travesty that we don't have a system to correlate this and actually investigate.\n\nMr. Fraver suggests that instead of just having the airplanes, there should be other data sources out there, such as coastal radars that monitor our air defense identification zone.

He discussed his involvement in a secret Pentagon program called the Advanced Aerospace Threat Identification Program (AATIP), which investigated UFO sightings between 2007 and 2012. According to Dr. Davis, the program collected data from various sources, including military pilots, satellite imagery, and radar signals. Despite its success in gathering information about UAPs, the program was shut down due to budget constraints.\n\nDr. Davis also shared details about a briefing he attended at the Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA) in 2019 where he saw videos of UAP encounters that were not part of the AATIP database. These new videos showed objects exhibiting unusual flight characteristics such as extreme maneuverability, hypersonic speeds, and near-instantaneous acceleration/deceleration. One video even depicted an object hovering over water before suddenly disappearing beneath the surface without creating any visible disturbance or splash.\n\nAnother witness, Commander David Fravor, described his encounter with a Tic Tac-shaped UAP while flying an F/A-18 fighter jet off the coast of San Diego in November 2004. The object appeared to be around 40 feet long and had no visible means of propulsion. It moved erratically, changing direction rapidly and maintaining a constant altitude despite strong wind conditions. After approximately five minutes, the object disappeared into the ocean depths.\n\nCommander Fravor's testimony was corroborated by Lieutenant Ryan Graves, who reported seeing similar UAPs during training flights between 2014 and 2015. He noted that these objects often displayed advanced capabilities like instantaneous acceleration, high-speed turns, and sudden stops. In one instance, he observed two large white aircraft moving at incredible speed \u2013 faster than anything humanly possible \u2013 while remaining completely silent.\n\nLieutenant Colonel Anthony \"Scooter\" Yenni also testified about his experience with UAPs during a flight near Japan in 2019. While conducting routine operations, he noticed several small unidentified objects on radar that were not responding to radio communications or evasive maneuvers. One of the objects eventually collided with another, causing both to disintegrate and disappear from radar. This incident prompted an investigation by the Japanese government but yielded no conclusive answers as to what the objects were.\n\nAnother witness, Captain Mark Ritzmann, described how he encountered a triangular-shaped UAP while flying over the Atlantic Ocean in 2018. The object appeared suddenly out of nowhere and began following his plane for approximately five minutes before vanishing without explanation. During this time, it exhibited unusual behavior such as changing altitude rapidly and maintaining a constant distance despite strong wind conditions.\n\nCaptain Ritzmann's testimony was supported by Lieutenant Colonels Chad Underwood and Jeffrey Churchill, who shared their own experiences with UAPs during training flights off the coast of California between 2014 and 2015. They reported seeing multiple instances where these mysterious objects displayed advanced capabilities like instantaneous acceleration, high-speed turns, and sudden stops \u2013 all without making any noise or leaving behind visible debris.\n\nThe final two witnesses, Mr. Ronald Moultrie and Dr. Sean Kirkpatrick, discussed their involvement in Project Blue Book, which investigated UFO sightings from 1947 to 1969. According to them, many cases remain unexplained even after extensive analysis due to lack of physical evidence or reliable eyewitness accounts. Despite this, they believe that continued research into UAP phenomena is essential for advancing our understanding of the universe and potentially discovering new technologies that could benefit humanity.\n\nIn conclusion, the testimonies provided by these 10 UAP witnesses highlight the need for increased transparency and research into these mysterious aerial phenomena. While some may dismiss such encounters as mere coincidences or misidentifications, it's clear that there are still many unanswered questions surrounding UAPs that deserve serious consideration. As we continue exploring the vast expanse of space"

However, when asked directly whether his statement was accurate, Rep. Schiff pointed out a contradiction between what Dr. Kirkpatrick said and an actual quote from him which indicated otherwise - demonstrating why we need more transparency in our government.\n\nRep. Mark Green then took over the line of questioning, asking for examples of how confusion has arisen due to lack of transparency within the government. He cited the Chinese spy balloon debacle earlier this year as one such example where mass confusion ensued after news broke about it entering US airspace over Alaska four days prior; followed by continuous series of embarrassments once mainstream media got involved. After initial assurances that the object posed no threat to security, fighter jets were scrambled off South Carolina coast only after allowing it to traverse entire continental United States first \u2013 causing unnecessary fear, panic & confusion across country.

The first witness, Mr. Luis Elizondo, served as the Director of Programs within the Office of the Secretary of Defense from 2009 to 2017. He was responsible for managing sensitive programs related to counterintelligence, counterterrorism, and other national security issues.\n\nThe second witness, Dr. Travis Taylor, is a physicist and former NASA scientist who currently serves as the Chief Science Officer at TTG Innovations LLC. He has authored numerous books on space exploration and technology development.\n\nThe third witness, Mr. Christopher Mellon, is a former Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense for Intelligence in the Clinton and Bush administrations. He also served as an adviser to the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence.\n\nDuring the hearing, they were asked questions about the origins of UAPs, whether there is life out there, how military pilots feel empowered to share their experiences, seeking scientists to sit on their advisory board, facilitating partnerships between the scientific community and the UAP focus groups within government, and if the U.S. government has become aware of actual evidence of extraterrestrials or otherwise unexplained forms of intelligence.\n\nMr. Elizondo stated that he believes there is life out there and that either way, these actions ultimately led NASA to assemble the independent study team that he mentioned earlier. He also mentioned that Harvard University stood up the Galileo Project to research and examine the origins of UAPs.\n\nDr. Taylor discussed how both from NASA and in the higher education community, due to the work done by people like them, the stigma surrounding UAPs is slowly going away. He also said that he thinks we're seeing some of that stigma disappear because of the work done by the witnesses and others.\n\nMr. Mellon agreed with Dr. Taylor and added that starting in 2017, when it actually came out, it took that stigma away. He also mentioned that now they are sitting here today for a public testimony on what's actually going on, which shows that the curve is becoming more exponential and they will get more and more transparent to the level that they can.\n\nIn response to a question about seeking scientists to sit on their advisory board, Mr. Graves said that he thinks this is an engineering and scientific problem as much as a national security problem. He also mentioned that he has been working with the American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics to help them stand up a UAP integration committee to help integrate their engineering prowess into this problem.\n\nWhen asked how Congress can help facilitate partnerships between the scientific community and the UAP focus groups within government, Mr. Graves said that one thing they can do is have these types of hearings to communicate to the public that this is a topic of interest. He also added that continued conversation and reduction of stigma will allow answers to help generate themselves.\n\nMr. Comer thanked everyone for being here and said that it's important to keep our top scientific minds focused on this issue and look for ways to increase collaboration."

When questioned why no video footage existed despite having clear airspace, he explained that when on a test mission like this one over Gulf of Mexico, pilots are supposed to have clear airspace without anything showing up; however, upon seeing four crafts forming a diamond formation (with accompanying radar sequence), one pilot decided to check it out only to find a large floating orb again not of any known human capability.

He sought a briefing regarding the episode and brought two other representatives - Burchitt and Luna - along for support. They asked to see all evidence taken by flight crew during the encounter, including images and radar signatures, but were initially denied access to these items. After some discussion on authority flow within the United States, they finally got to meet with one member of the flight crew who took an image of something unidentifiable as either human-made or belonging to any adversary nation. The representative also mentions seeing a sequence of four craft in a clear diamond formation, which he claims has been observed only once before in Congress. One pilot went to check out the formation and saw a large floating orb, which malfunctioned their FLIR system when approached. This caused them to manually take an image from one lens instead of using automated collection methods typically used during test missions."

Lack of coordination among government agencies for investigating UAP sightings: Dr. Sean Kirkpatrick stated that there is no centralized database within the US Government to collect information on UAP sightings, making it difficult to analyze them effectively. He also mentioned that some countries such as France have established an official body responsible for studying these events.\n\n2. Need for a comprehensive strategy to address national security implications of UAPs: Mr. Christopher Mellon emphasized the importance of developing a coordinated approach between various intelligence communities and military branches to understand the nature of UAPs and protect against potential threats they may pose. He suggested creating a new office within the Department of Defense dedicated solely to this purpose.\n\n3. Potential technological advancements from reverse engineering non-terrestrial craft: When asked if he knew individuals willing to testify about participating in reverse engineering programs for non-terrestrial craft, Mr. Timothy Burchard replied affirmatively but noted that assurances would be needed not to punish them administratively for breaking their NDA. This suggests that there could potentially be valuable insights gained by studying recovered materials or technology associated with UAPs.\n\n4. Concerns over white collar crimes related to cover-up attempts: In response to a question regarding possible violations of federal acquisition regulations (FAR) due to a cover-up attempt, Mr. Fraver stated his concerns based on interviews conducted under his official duties as an Air Force officer. This raises questions about whether any government officials have engaged in unethical behavior while investigating or dealing with UAP sightings.\n\n5. Specific treaties between governments mentioning UAPs: During his testimony, Mr. Grush referenced Article 3 of the Nuclear Arms Treaty with Russia which specifically mentions UAPs and suggested that safety measures may exist between foreign powers to avoid escalatory situations should a malicious event occur involving one of these objects. He also cited other publicly available treaties such as the George Washington University National Security Archives' declassified documents from 2013 containing specific provisions relating to nuclear warfare scenarios involving UAPs."

The witnesses included military personnel, scientists, and government officials. They discussed various aspects of the UAP phenomenon, such as its nature, potential national security implications, and the need for further research and investigation.\n\nOne witness, Mr. Fraver, described an encounter he had in 2004 while working at a nuclear missile site in Montana. He claimed that this was the most credible UFO sighting in history and said it involved a large, metallic object hovering over his base for several hours before disappearing suddenly. Another witness, Dr. Puthoff, shared his belief that there is evidence suggesting that some UAPs may be extraterrestrial in origin.\n\nSeveral witnesses raised concerns about possible white-collar crimes related to a cover-up of information about UAPs. One witness, Mr. Grush, cited specific treaties between governments and mentioned Article 3 of the Nuclear Arms Treaty with Russia, which identifies UAPs. He also referenced a declassified document from the George Washington University National Security Archives that contains specific provisions related to UAPs.\n\nThe witnesses called for increased transparency, cooperation among nations, and more scientific research into the UAP phenomenon. They emphasized the importance of protecting national security interests and ensuring public safety in relation to UAPs."

The first witness was Lue Elizondo, who served as Director of Operations for the Advanced Aerospace Threat Identification Program from 2010-2017. He explained that he came forward because he felt it was his duty to protect national security interests by disclosing information about UAPs.\n\nThe second witness was Christopher Mellon, former Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense for Intelligence in both the Clinton and George W. Bush administrations. He stated that he decided to come forward due to a sense of duty after being pestered by a friend who believed he could add credibility to an article published by The New York Times.\n\nThe third witness was Commander David Fravor, a retired United States Navy pilot who flew F/A-18 fighter jets during Operation Iraqi Freedom and later became one of the first pilots to encounter a UAP while flying off the coast of San Diego on November 14th, 2004. When asked why he chose to speak out publicly, he said it was because \"I don't think there is a lot of public options for every man to be able to report on this.\""

                    "answer": "3 witnesses were interviewed about their experiences with unidentified aerial phenomena (UAP). The first witness was Mr. Graves, who described his experience as an F-18 pilot encountering multiple cube-like objects while flying near the East Coast of the United States. He stated that he saw these objects up close at around 50 feet away from them, which left him puzzled due to their lack of visible propulsion systems or other identifiable features.\n\nThe second witness was Mr. Garrosh, also an F-18 pilot, who shared similar encounters during his time in service. According to him, he encountered several instances where he had to take evasive action because of the proximity of these mysterious objects. Despite being trained as an aviation safety officer by the Navy, he felt compelled to come forward and share his story out of duty and responsibility towards his fellow pilots still facing such threats.\n\nLastly, Commander Grush provided valuable insights into the security review process for UAP information. He explained that based on Doppser's assessment, only unclassified questions could be answered in open sessions like this one. However, any classified matters would require a closed session at the appropriate level. When asked about commercial pilots reporting sightings of UAPs, he confirmed that they too have seen them but with less range and sensors compared to military aircraft.\n\nWhen questioned further about the most vivid sighting involving cube-like objects, Mr. Graves described how two fighter jets flew within 50 feet of one such object near midair - right at the entrance to their working area along the eastern seaboard. This close encounter left both pilots stunned and confused due to the lack of visible propulsion systems or other identifiable features on the object.\n\nIn response to another question regarding why he came forward on this issue, Mr. Garrosh stated that it was primarily because he wanted to help his colleagues who were still flying and dealing with these mysterious aerial phenomena. As an aviation safety officer trained by the Navy, he felt compelled to share his experiences out of duty and responsibility towards those facing similar threats.\n\nCommander Grush also shared his reasons for coming forward: after being pestered multiple times by a friend, he eventually agreed to do so as \"the one person [they] can't discredit\" and would add credibility to The New York Times article. He emphasized that this town isn't made up entirely of people like them but rather individuals who keep this issue alive despite criticism and derogatory remarks.\n\nThe witnesses expressed gratitude for the public's support in keeping this topic alive and encouraged everyone watching to continue reporting UAP sightings if possible. They acknowledged that there are currently limited options available for every man to report their encounters directly; however, they urge citizens not to lose hope and continue seeking answers through various channels such as social media platforms or contacting local authorities when appropriate."

The discussion starts with Representative Adam Schiff asking if there has been any progress in understanding these unidentified aerial phenomena (UAP). He then asks about the role of Congress in addressing this issue.\n\nRepresentative Mike Gallagher shares his experience as a former intelligence officer and emphasizes the importance of having an open mind when dealing with such matters. He also mentions that he believes there needs to be more collaboration between government agencies and private companies on this topic.\n\nDr. Sean Kirkpatrick from the Pentagon's All-domain Anomaly Resolution Office (AARO) explains how they approach investigating UAP sightings and what kind of data they collect during their research. He stresses the need for objective data collection through technology solutions like sensors distributed across various locations.\n\nFormer Deputy Director of National Intelligence Sue Gordon talks about encouraging conversations around UAPs and looking into technology solutions that can provide objective information. She also highlights the importance of whistleblowers coming forward legally to share their experiences and knowledge.\n\nMr. Ronald Moultrie, Under Secretary of Defense for Intelligence & Security, discusses the challenges faced by the Department of Defense (DoD) in identifying and tracking UAPs due to limited resources and funding constraints. He suggests working closely with other countries who may have similar interests or capabilities in order to better understand these phenomena.\n\nMs. Elizondo shares her experience as a former Special Agent In Charge at the Department of Defense and emphasizes the need for an open dialogue among experts within different fields such as science, engineering, and intelligence communities. She believes this will help create a more comprehensive understanding of UAPs and potentially lead to breakthrough discoveries.\n\nDr. Garash from AARO explains how his team uses artificial intelligence (AI) tools to analyze large amounts of sensor data collected during UAP investigations. He stresses the importance of having access to high-quality sensors distributed across various locations so that they can gather accurate information on these unidentified objects.\n\nFormer Deputy Director of Naval Intelligence Scott Bray talks about encouraging current and former military personnel, intelligence community members, and industry contractors to come forward legally if they have any knowledge related to UAP sightings or encounters. He also mentions that he is not like his father - a United States Marine Corps veteran - but still manages to do fine!\n\nMr. Chris Mellon, former Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense for Intelligence, discusses the role of accident investigation in dealing with UAP incidents. He advises witnesses not to try and make the fish bigger than it was by speculating what they think it is; instead, stick to the facts and write them down without embellishment. This way, all the facts can be gathered together and an honest story can emerge rather than just one person's interpretation."

The discussion began with Representative Adam Schiff asking each panelist about their background in UAP research or experience.\n\nThe first panelist, Dr. Sean Kirkpatrick, shared his expertise as a physicist who has studied plasma physics and electromagnetism. He explained how these fields could be involved in creating UAPs and emphasized that more scientific study is needed to understand them better.\n\nNext, Ms. Tracy Torme spoke about her work on the television series \"The X-Files\" and her belief that there are extraterrestrial civilizations visiting Earth. She argued that governments should release classified information about UAPs to help advance human knowledge.\n\nDr. David Fravor then described his encounter with an unknown aircraft while flying a Navy fighter jet off the coast of San Diego in 2004. He stated that he believes it was not made by humans but does not know what else it could have been.\n\nMr. Christopher Mellon followed up by sharing his experience working at the Pentagon's Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA). He claimed that the government has collected thousands of reports of UAP sightings over many years but has failed to adequately investigate them due to bureaucratic obstacles and lack of funding.\n\nMs. Elizondo continued this discussion by explaining why she thinks the government needs to take UAPs seriously. She cited examples from other countries like France, which recently released its own report on UAPs after conducting extensive research.\n\nMr. Garash shared his perspective as a former intelligence officer who now works for the Department of Homeland Security. He emphasized the importance of collecting objective data through technology solutions and encouraged current and former military personnel to come forward if they have any relevant information.\n\nThe next panelist, Mr. Gimbel, discussed his work analyzing UAP data for the Office of Naval Intelligence (ONI) and the DIA. He argued that there is enough evidence to suggest that some UAPs are likely extraterrestrial in origin but stressed the need for more scientific study before drawing definitive conclusions.\n\nDr. Puthoff then spoke about her background in quantum physics and remote viewing research at Stanford Research Institute (SRI). She explained how these techniques could potentially be used to gather information about UAPs without direct physical contact or observation.\n\nFinally, Ms. Torme returned to discuss the potential implications of disclosing classified information about UAPs. While acknowledging concerns over national security risks, she argued that releasing this information would ultimately benefit humanity by advancing our understanding of the universe and possibly leading to new technologies.\n\nThroughout the discussion, several themes emerged: the need for further investigation into UAPs using science-based approaches; the importance of collecting objective data through technology solutions; and the potential benefits of government transparency regarding classified information on UAPs. The panelists also emphasized the value of collaboration between scientists, military personnel, intelligence agencies, and other stakeholders to advance our knowledge of these mysterious phenomena."
