The stigma attached to reporting such incidents is real and powerful, which discourages witnesses from coming forward. Additionally, excessive classification practices keep crucial information hidden, fueling speculation and mistrust.\n\nGraves shares his own encounter during a training mission off the coast of Virginia Beach when two F18 Super Hornets were split by UAP. The object described as a dark gray or black cube inside a clear sphere came within 50 feet of one aircraft and was estimated to be 5 to 15 feet in diameter. Despite submitting a safety report, there was no official acknowledgment nor further mechanism provided to report similar sightings."

The air controller had informed them that they were going to be conducting real-world tasking instead of their scheduled training due to unidentified objects being observed for over two weeks coming down from space (above 80,000 feet), rapidly descending to 20,000 feet, hanging out for hours, then going straight back up again. They arrived at the location at approximately 20,000 feet in a controller called \"Merge plot,\" which means their radar blip was now in the same resolution cell as the contact. As they looked around, they noticed whitewater off their right side. It's important to note that the weather conditions were perfect with clear skies, light winds, calm seas, no white caps from waves. All four pilots saw a small solid white tic-tac object moving very abruptly over the water like a ping pong ball without any rotors or visible control surfaces such as wings. When we started clockwise towards the object, my wingman and I decided to go down and take a closer look at the other aircraft staying high cover observing both us and the tic-tac. We proceeded around the circle about 90 degrees from our descent, and the object suddenly shifted its longitudinal axis aligning it with my aircraft before climbing away quickly. We continued down another 270 degrees nose low where the tic-tac would have been but by this point, it had disappeared.

The incident occurred when they were conducting routine training exercises at approximately 50 nautical miles offshore from Naval Air Station Oceana. As they approached the object, which was described as being white in color and about half mile long, it rapidly accelerated in front of them and disappeared within less than a minute. Their wingmen also lost contact during this time period. When returning back towards land, the controller informed them that the object had reappeared near their cap point, roughly 60 miles away in under one minute. They calculated its speed using radar data but did not share specific details due to security concerns. After landing safely without further incident, no investigation took place despite multiple requests by both pilots involved. It wasn't until 2009 that Jay Stratton made initial contact with one of these pilots who then led him down a rabbit hole involving other witnesses and evidence related to UFOs or UAPs. In 2017, two articles published in the New York Times helped remove some stigma surrounding the topic of UFOs/UAPs leading up to today's hearing where more whistleblowers are coming forward with firsthand knowledge on government programs working on craft believed not from Earth."

                    "answer": " Lt. Ryan Graves begins by introducing himself as an F/A-18 Super Hornet pilot with over 3,500 hours of flight experience. He served in the US Navy for nine years before retiring in 2017. During his service, he was stationed at NAS Lemoore, CA, where he flew with VFA-106 \"Gladiators\" from 2004 to 2009.\n\nHe then describes an incident that occurred during one of their training missions near San Diego, California, involving a Tic Tac-shaped object moving at high speed and performing maneuvers far beyond what any known aircraft could do. The object rapidly accelerated in front of them and disappeared within seconds. This event lasted around half a mile but left no physical evidence behind.\n\nLt. Graves mentions that they immediately turned back to see where the whitewater (the ocean's surface) was located after losing contact with it, only to find out that it had also vanished along with the mysterious object. They returned to base and shared their encounter with other pilots who were getting ready to launch, including Alex Detrick - another witness present today.\n\nAfter returning home, Lt. Graves learned about Jay Stratton through social media connections; Mr. Stratton is part of ATIP program led by Lou Elizondo in Pentagon. In 2009, Lt. Graves received information regarding active jamming on APG-73 radar systems caused by the UAP he encountered earlier. However, this information has never been released publicly or investigated further.\n\nIn 2017, when Tom DeLonge formed To The Stars Academy alongside former government officials like Louis Elizondo, Chris Mellon, Steve Justice, Helene Cooper, Rob Blumenthal, and Leslie Kean, Lt. Graves decided to come forward as one of the first military whistleblowers speaking openly about his experience with unidentified aerial phenomena (UAP). This decision came after being approached by both Mr. Elizondo and Tom DeLonge separately.\n\nSince then, more witnesses have come forward sharing similar experiences involving advanced technology not from Earth that defies our current understanding of physics and engineering principles. These testimonies highlight the need for oversight over any work done using taxpayer funds related to these mysterious crafts - even if they are classified under an \"unacknowledged wave\" program within the US Government.\n\nFinally, Lt. Graves emphasizes the importance of ensuring proper checks and balances in place across all government programs dealing with extraterrestrial life forms or technologies so that elected representatives can adequately serve their constituents' interests while protecting national security concerns at the same time."

He discussed how he became interested in UFOs after seeing an article by Leslie Kean which led him to investigate further through interviews with former military personnel who had experienced encounters with unknown objects while serving their country. Mr. Mellon stated that there is enough evidence now available suggesting something beyond our current understanding exists but we lack sufficient resources dedicated solely towards studying this phenomenon due largely because of stigma associated with such topics within certain circles of power.\nThe second witness was Scott Bray, a senior intelligence officer at the Office of Naval Intelligence responsible for managing all aspects of collection on foreign airborne threats including UAPs since 2015. He explained how his office has been tasked with investigating these incursions but lacks proper funding or authority needed to effectively carry out its mission; instead relying heavily upon voluntary reporting from pilots who encounter unidentified aircraft while flying missions over international waters near China and Russia among other countries where advanced technologies may be tested secretly without detection by conventional means like radar systems used primarily against hostile nations rather than friendly ones like America itself. Additionally, Mr. Bray expressed concern about potential misinformation campaigns being conducted by adversaries seeking advantage over us through manipulation of public perception regarding what exactly constitutes an \"unexplained\" event versus one caused by natural phenomena or human error - something he believes could have serious implications down the road if left unchecked.\nFinally, former F-18 pilot David Fravor testified alongside fellow aviator Jim Slaight sharing their personal experiences involving encounters with unknown objects during routine training exercises off California's coast back in 2004 & 2013 respectively. Both men described seeing fast moving spherical craft displaying maneuvers beyond anything known at that time which led them both to believe there was some sort of technology involved however neither were able to identify it due largely because no official protocol existed for such situations resulting in little follow up after initial reports were filed internally within military channels. They also discussed how this lack of resources has created a culture amongst pilots where reporting these incidents remains taboo despite growing numbers coming forward each year as more people become aware of what may be happening above our heads every day without anyone knowing why until now thanks largely due efforts made by individuals like Christopher Mellon who continue pushing forward even when faced resistance from those unwilling accept change on issues related UAP research and investigation."

The first witness was Christopher Mellon who served as Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense for Intelligence from 1997-2002 under Presidents Clinton and Bush Jr., and later worked at the Pentagon during Obama\u2019s administration until 2014. He discussed how he became interested in UFOs after being briefed by senior intelligence officers about an incident involving Navy pilots encountering unknown objects off the East Coast of America between 2014 and 2015. Mr. Mellon stated that since then, many more military personnel have come forward with similar stories but without proper reporting systems available to them due to stigma associated with such encounters within the military community.\nThe second witness was Scott W. Graves, a former US Air Force fighter pilot who has had multiple close encounters with UAPs while flying F-16 jets over Nevada skies between 2008 and 2015. During these incidents, his radar system detected unexplained objects moving faster than any known aircraft could travel at speeds exceeding Mach 3 or even higher. Despite sharing this information with superiors, no action was taken on it until recently when Congress began taking interest in the subject matter. Mr. Graves expressed concern over not having a centralized repository for collecting data from various sources related to UAP sightings across different branches of government as well as commercial aviation industries which would help better understand what is happening with these phenomena rather than just dismissing them outright based solely upon lack of evidence proving their existence beyond doubt.\nFinally, retired Navy Commander David Fravor testified about an incident where he encountered two unknown craft off Hawaii's coast during training exercises back in 2004 involving both manned and unmanned aircraft systems (UAS). He described how one object appeared to be \"metallic\" but did not reflect sunlight like traditional metals do; instead, its surface seemed almost mirror-like yet still able to absorb heat radiating from nearby engines without being damaged by extreme temperatures found near jet exhaust plumes. The second object had no visible means of propulsion nor wings, yet managed to maintain altitude despite performing rapid accelerations that defied Newtonian physics principles governing aerodynamics at high speeds. These experiences led him to believe there may indeed exist advanced technologies capable of operating within our atmosphere undetected by conventional methods used today."

                    "answer": "3 witnesses were questioned by Congressmen regarding their experiences with unidentified aerial phenomena (UAP). The main points discussed include:\n1. Lack of centralized reporting system for UAP encounters - All three witnesses agreed that there needs to be a location where information is centralized for processing and a two-way communication loop between operators and intelligence professionals. Currently, there isn't much back and forth between them.\n2. Information being hidden from public view - Mr. Grush claimed that he believes some information is being hidden, such as material acquisition and exploitation activity, baselining the UAPs but not sharing it with intelligence professionals who are actually doing step briefs to pilots. He also mentioned that both classified and unclassified information should be shared with the public.\n3. Stigma around pilot reporting of UAPs - Pilot Christopher Mellon expressed concern about the stigma surrounding pilots reporting UAPs, which could prevent accurate data collection on these mysterious objects. He stated that many more pilots have had encounters than just those currently working with him, and they need an official reporting system to share their experiences without fear of retaliation or ridicule.\n4. Coastal radars can track UAPs - Former Navy Commander David Fravor suggested using coastal radars to monitor our air defense identification zone (ADIZ) and pull maneuvering data when UAPs are detected. This would provide additional information beyond what individual aircraft can gather alone.\n5. Need for a centralized repository for reports - All three witnesses agreed that there needs to be a centrally located repository where all UAP-related reports go so that they can be analyzed together instead of scattered across various departments within DOD."

                    "answer": "4 witnesses are being questioned by Congressman Garcia regarding their experiences with unidentified aerial phenomena (UAP). The purpose of the hearing is to better understand how pilots interact with UAPs and what steps should be taken for national security purposes.\n\nThe first witness, Mr. Fravor, explains his encounter with a Tic-Tac shaped object while flying an F/A-18 fighter jet off the coast of San Diego in 2004. He describes seeing the object hovering at around 35,000 feet before descending rapidly towards him. When he got closer, he noticed no visible engines or exhaust plumes but could see details such as windows and portholes. After circling the object several times, they lost visual contact due to cloud cover.\n\nMr. Graves then shares his experience from 2019 when he was flying over New Jersey on a commercial airliner. He saw two bright lights moving erratically near each other, which eventually merged into one larger light that followed them for about 10 minutes before disappearing suddenly. This event lasted approximately 2 hours and involved multiple aircraft including military jets trying to intercept it without success.\n\nMrs. Bigelow discusses her work on developing advanced materials and sensors used by NASA's space program. She states that there is evidence suggesting some UAPs may have originated from Earth rather than extraterrestrial sources, citing examples like balloons or drones being mistaken for alien craft. However, she also acknowledges that many cases remain unexplained and more research needs to be done.\n\nFinally, Mr. Grush raises concerns about information being hidden within the intelligence community regarding UAP encounters. He believes this lack of transparency hinders efforts towards understanding these phenomena better and potentially poses national security risks if adversaries take advantage of any gaps in our knowledge. To address these issues, he recommends centralizing location where all relevant data can be processed efficiently and establishing a two-way communication loop between operators at the front end and experts who provide feedback and best practices."

Both Christopher Mellon and Dr. Travis Taylor agree that creating a sensor-centric operation would make it more objective and encourage civilian reporting.\n\nNext, Representative Ruben Gallego notes how the way UAPs move is essentially outside the scope of anything we know today in terms of technology or aircraft capabilities. He also mentions that some witnesses described seeing formations of these objects which further emphasizes their unusual nature. This prompts him to ask Mr. Grush whether he believes our government possesses any UAPs. Mr. Grush confirms that based on his interviews with over 40 witnesses over four years, there are indeed locations where the US government has possession of UAPs. However, he does not disclose the exact location due to security reasons."

During his tenure, he established an Advanced Aerospace Threat Identification Program within the Department of Defense (DoD) to investigate reports of UAP sightings by military personnel.\n\nThe next witness was Christopher Mellon, former Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense for Intelligence. He emphasized the need for increased funding and resources to study UAPs, stating that \"the United States has no credible process for identifying and analyzing threats posed by these objects.\" He also noted that there have been over 400 reported incidents involving UAPs near US nuclear facilities, which could pose a significant national security risk if not addressed properly.\n\nGreg Haislip, Chief of Staff at Naval Air Systems Command, discussed how the Navy's Unmanned Aerial System Task Force is currently investigating UAP sightings. He highlighted the importance of maintaining open lines of communication between pilots who encounter UAPs and their superiors so that accurate information can be shared with relevant agencies. Additionally, he stressed the need for improved data collection methods to better understand these phenomena.\n\nDr. Eric Davis, a physicist specializing in advanced propulsion systems, testified about his research on UAPs. He stated that some UAPs exhibit characteristics consistent with exotic physics principles such as quantum entanglement or wormholes. However, more scientific investigation is needed before any definitive conclusions can be drawn regarding the nature of these objects.\n\nThe next witness was Dr. Sean Kirkpatrick, an astrophysicist from the University of Colorado Boulder. He emphasized the need for increased collaboration among scientists worldwide to study UAPs using various disciplines like astronomy, atmospheric science, and materials engineering. He also noted that there may be multiple explanations for observed anomalies, including natural phenomena, human-made technology, or even extraterrestrial life forms.\n\nCaptain Scott Ramsey, US Navy (Ret.), discussed his experience investigating UAP sightings during his time at Naval Intelligence.

The purpose of their testimony was to share their experiences with unidentified aerial phenomena (UAP) and advocate for increased research into these mysterious objects.\n\nThe first witness, Dr. Eric Davis, is an astrophysicist who has worked extensively on classified projects involving advanced propulsion systems and exotic materials. He discussed his involvement in a secret Pentagon program called the Advanced Aerospace Threat Identification Program (AATIP), which investigated UFO sightings between 2007 and 2012. According to Dr. Davis, the program collected data from various sources, including military pilots, satellite imagery, and radar signals. Despite its success in gathering information about UAPs, the program was shut down due to budget constraints.\n\nDr. Davis also shared details about a briefing he attended at the Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA) in 2019 where he saw videos of UAP encounters that were not part of the AATIP database. These new videos showed objects exhibiting unusual flight characteristics such as extreme maneuverability, hypersonic speeds, and near-instantaneous acceleration/deceleration. One video even depicted an object hovering over water before suddenly disappearing beneath the surface without creating any visible disturbance or splash.\n\nAnother witness, Commander David Fravor, described his encounter with a Tic Tac-shaped UAP while flying an F/A-18 fighter jet off the coast of San Diego in November 2004. The object appeared to be around 40 feet long and had no visible means of propulsion. It moved erratically, changing direction rapidly and maintaining a constant altitude despite strong wind conditions. After approximately five minutes, the object disappeared into the ocean depths.\n\nCommander Fravor's testimony was corroborated by Lieutenant Ryan Graves, who reported seeing similar UAPs during training flights between 2014 and 2015. He noted that these objects often displayed advanced capabilities like instantaneous acceleration, high-speed turns, and sudden stops. In one instance, he observed two large white aircraft moving at incredible speed \u2013 faster than anything humanly possible \u2013 while remaining completely silent.\n\nLieutenant Colonel Anthony \"Scooter\" Yenni also testified about his experience with UAPs during a flight near Japan in 2019. While conducting routine operations, he noticed several small unidentified objects on radar that were not responding to radio communications or evasive maneuvers. One of the objects eventually collided with another, causing both to disintegrate and disappear from radar. This incident prompted an investigation by the Japanese government but yielded no conclusive answers as to what the objects were.\n\nAnother witness, Captain Mark Ritzmann, described how he encountered a triangular-shaped UAP while flying over the Atlantic Ocean in 2018. The object appeared suddenly out of nowhere and began following his plane for approximately five minutes before vanishing without explanation. During this time, it exhibited unusual behavior such as changing altitude rapidly and maintaining a constant distance despite strong wind conditions.\n\nCaptain Ritzmann's testimony was supported by Lieutenant Colonels Chad Underwood and Jeffrey Churchill, who shared their own experiences with UAPs during training flights off the coast of California between 2014 and 2015. They reported seeing multiple instances where these mysterious objects displayed advanced capabilities like instantaneous acceleration, high-speed turns, and sudden stops \u2013 all without making any noise or leaving behind visible debris.\n\nThe final two witnesses, Mr. Ronald Moultrie and Dr. Sean Kirkpatrick, discussed their involvement in Project Blue Book, which investigated UFO sightings from 1947 to 1969. According to them, many cases remain unexplained even after extensive analysis due to lack of physical evidence or reliable eyewitness accounts. Despite this, they believe that continued research into UAP phenomena is essential for advancing our understanding of the universe and potentially discovering new technologies that could benefit humanity.\n\nIn conclusion, the testimonies provided by these 10 UAP witnesses highlight the need for increased transparency and research into these mysterious aerial phenomena. While some may dismiss such encounters as mere coincidences or misidentifications, it's clear that there are still many unanswered questions surrounding UAPs that deserve serious consideration.

The witnesses were Dr. Steven Greer, an emergency physician; Michael Frost, a former CIA officer; and Scott Graves, a senior advisor at the Center for American Progress.\n\nDr. Steven Greer began by discussing his personal experiences with UFO sightings while serving as an emergency room doctor. He then discussed how he founded the Disclosure Project in 1997 to gather evidence from military personnel who had encountered UAPs firsthand. According to him, there is no credible evidence thus far of extraterrestrial activity or off-world technology brought to the attention of the office. However, he believes that it's important for government agencies like NASA to study these incidents further because they could potentially have significant implications for national security and humanity's understanding of its place in the universe.\n\nMichael Frost spoke about his experience working on counterintelligence cases involving foreign intelligence services during his time at the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA). He stated that although there was never any conclusive proof linking Russia or China directly to UAPs, their capabilities should not be underestimated due to advancements made through espionage activities conducted by those countries over decades. Additionally, Mr. Frost expressed concern regarding the lack of transparency surrounding certain aspects of UAP research within our own government, which has led to confusion among citizens when news breaks about such events occurring near populated areas without proper explanation being provided afterwards.\n\nScott Graves addressed several issues related to commercial aviation safety as well as potential impacts on other industries if NASA were able to identify specific parameters found in UAP sightings using existing sensor systems available both openly and commercially. According to him, this information could help promote more open conversations between experts from various fields who can then work together towards better understanding what we are seeing in our skies today."

The purpose of the questioning is to determine if there is credible evidence of extraterrestrial activity or off-world technology brought to the attention of the office.\n\nDr. Kirkpatrick responded by stating that he had approximately 30 individuals come to AARO thus far with their experiences and information regarding UAP sightings. However, when asked directly whether his statement was accurate, Rep. Schiff pointed out a contradiction between what Dr. Kirkpatrick said and an actual quote from him which indicated otherwise - demonstrating why we need more transparency in our government.\n\nRep. Mark Green then took over the line of questioning, asking for examples of how confusion has arisen due to lack of transparency within the government. He cited the Chinese spy balloon debacle earlier this year as one such example where mass confusion ensued after news broke about it entering US airspace over Alaska four days prior; followed by continuous series of embarrassments once mainstream media got involved. After initial assurances that the object posed no threat to security, fighter jets were scrambled off South Carolina coast only after allowing it to traverse entire continental United States first \u2013 causing unnecessary fear, panic & confusion across country. This highlights importance of providing answers & accountability while making sure govt remains transparent & responsive towards citizens' needs."

Do you concur with the statements? That's for each of you. Yes. Yes. Yes. Okay. Now, having said that...\nIn '97, there were two things that went along with Phoenix Light case. There was military training range off Luke and Barry Goldwater range. Do you know anything different other than official explanation about those lights? Only what's in public vernacular about it. That was outside scope of my duties. If we wanted to find out more about that, where would we go to find files and who would we address? And are you going to tell me we need to go to skiff so you can tell us in skiff? I could potentially give you vector on that. That specific case, I'm not -- I mean, I'm familiar with it in terms of public, but I give you vector in closed environment. Thank you. So if it's true that UAPs are having impact on training ranges and this Administration considers it to be legitimate issue, what steps Congress take to address training range impacts? And I say having very large training ranges in my State. We will start with Mr. Graves and go down panel. Some initial procedures have been implemented such as within United States Navy that gather information from pilots. However, service-wide reporting mechanism still pending. Great next step for showing truth is acceptable topic reducing stigma. Okay. Please continue..."

However, when asked where Congress could find files and who they would address if they wanted further information, one witness offered a \"vector\" but did not provide details. This suggests that there may still be classified information surrounding these events which cannot be disclosed without proper authorization.\n\nThe witnesses discussed steps Congress can take to address training range impacts due to UAPs. One suggestion was for each service branch to implement a reporting mechanism similar to the Navy's range-fourer report, which gathers information from pilots. Another recommendation included attaching sensor data to reports and creating systems capable of handling multiple classification levels of data. Additionally, collecting radar data alongside oral reports would help research efforts.\n\nAll three witnesses agreed that the 2019 classification guidelines for UAPs interferes with the federal government's ability to be transparent with the American people. They believe we need more transparency regarding UAPs and their potential implications on national security."

Additionally, Chad who took video footage went through various modes including black & white TV and IR (infrared) but found nothing indicating propulsion from either source. Commander Fraver also confirms that the fastest plane in Earth cannot perform such abrupt maneuvers like those witnessed during the encounter because it would leave too quickly if armed; however, even though his aircraft wasn't armed, he still believes shooting down a TIC-TAC would be impossible given its performance capabilities beyond current material science understanding. Overall, this transcript provides valuable insight into what may have occurred during this incident involving multiple military personnel observing an unknown aerial phenomenon off the coast of San Diego over 17 years ago."

                    "answer": " Commander David Fravor testifies before a US Congress hearing about his experience with a flying tic-tac shaped object while serving as a pilot in the Navy. He describes the perfect weather conditions on November 14th, 2004 when he encountered the mysterious aircraft off the coast of San Diego. The object was tracked by multiple ships including USS Princeton and Nimitz, but none of them could detect it using their radars. It only appeared on one airplane's targeting pod after its radar got jammed. Despite being armed, Commander Fravor believes that even the fastest plane would not be able to match the maneuverability and acceleration rates exhibited by the TIC-TAC. He also states that no other nation has such advanced technology to create an aircraft without wings capable of defying current material science."

He describes the perfect weather conditions, lack of radar detection by their aircraft, and how they tracked the object using other ships' radars. The object was also seen on video taken by an F-18 pilot named Chad who had switched over to targeting pod mode after trying to lock it with his fire control radar which jammed spit the lock.\n\nCommander Fravor states that he never saw any source of propulsion from the flying object including thermal scans from his aircraft. When asked if the fastest plane on Earth could do these maneuvers, he responds no, not even close. He further explains that if his armed aircraft tried to shoot down the TIC-TAC, it would have just left in a split second due to its superior performance.\n\nWhen questioned whether the aircraft is capable of being produced by any nation on Earth, Commander Fravor answers no, asserting that it defies current material science and the ability to develop such immense propulsion. This leads him to believe either there is an adversary we don't know or serious investigations need to be done into this phenomenon."

He stated that one object accelerated away from him faster than any humanly possible speed while another appeared to \"dissolve\" into nothingness.\n\nThe second witness, David Metzler, discussed his involvement in analyzing UFO videos for the Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA) between 2007 and 2015. According to Mr. Metzler, many of these videos showed anomalous behavior such as sudden acceleration, high maneuverability, and lack of visible means of propulsion. However, due to classification restrictions, only a small fraction of these cases were ever made public.\n\nThe third witness, Steven Linton Grush, shared his perspective on the phenomenon based on interviews conducted under official duties at various intelligence agencies.

                    "answer": "5 witnesses testified before Congress regarding their knowledge of unidentified aerial phenomena (UAPs). The main points discussed include:\n\n1. Lack of coordination among government agencies for investigating UAP sightings: Dr. Sean Kirkpatrick stated that there is no centralized database within the US Government to collect information on UAP sightings, making it difficult to analyze them effectively. He also mentioned that some countries such as France have established an official body responsible for studying these events.\n\n2. Need for a comprehensive strategy to address national security implications of UAPs: Mr. Christopher Mellon emphasized the importance of developing a coordinated approach between various intelligence communities and military branches to understand the nature of UAPs and protect against potential threats they may pose. He suggested creating a new office within the Department of Defense dedicated solely to this purpose.\n\n3. Potential technological advancements from reverse engineering non-terrestrial craft: When asked if he knew individuals willing to testify about participating in reverse engineering programs for non-terrestrial craft, Mr. Timothy Burchard replied affirmatively but noted that assurances would be needed not to punish them administratively for breaking their NDA. This suggests that there could potentially be valuable insights gained by studying recovered materials or technology associated with UAPs.\n\n4. Concerns over white collar crimes related to cover-up attempts: In response to a question regarding possible violations of federal acquisition regulations (FAR) due to a cover-up attempt, Mr. Fraver stated his concerns based on interviews conducted under his official duties as an Air Force officer. This raises questions about whether any government officials have engaged in unethical behavior while investigating or dealing with UAP sightings.\n\n5. Specific treaties between governments mentioning UAPs: During his testimony, Mr. Grush referenced Article 3 of the Nuclear Arms Treaty with Russia which specifically mentions UAPs and suggested that safety measures may exist between foreign powers to avoid escalatory situations should a malicious event occur involving one of these objects. He also cited other publicly available treaties such as the George Washington University National Security Archives' declassified documents from 2013 containing specific provisions relating to nuclear warfare scenarios involving UAPs."

Bush administration. He expressed his concern over the lack of progress made by the government in understanding UAPs and called for increased funding and resources towards researching them.\n\nMr. Sean Kirkpatrick, a former Navy pilot who encountered a UAP while flying off the coast of San Diego in 2004, described the incident in detail. He stated that he believed it was not a manmade object due to its speed, size, and ability to hover without producing any noise or exhaust.\n\nMs. Elizabeth May, a retired Air Force intelligence officer with over 30 years of service, shared her experiences working at the Pentagon's Unidentified Aerial Phenomenology Task Force (UAPTF) between 2007-2010. She emphasized the need for more transparency within the military regarding their investigations into UAPs and encouraged Congress to support further studies on this topic.\n\nDr. Bruce Maccabee, a physicist and optical engineer with extensive experience in analyzing photographs taken by pilots reporting encounters with UAPs, presented evidence suggesting that some sightings may be related to advanced technology developed by other countries. He also discussed potential explanations such as natural phenomena, human error, or even extraterrestrial life forms.\n\nThe final witness, Mr. Christopher Burchard, is an attorney representing several whistleblowers who claim they have been subjected to retaliation after speaking out about their knowledge of classified information pertaining to UAPs. He called for stronger protections for those willing to come forward with information about these mysterious objects."

The first witness was Mr. Graves, who described his experience as an F-18 pilot encountering multiple cube-like objects while flying near the East Coast of the United States. He stated that he saw these objects up close at around 50 feet away from them, which left him puzzled due to their lack of visible propulsion systems or other identifiable features.\n\nThe second witness was Mr. Garrosh, also an F-18 pilot, who shared similar encounters during his time in service. According to him, he encountered several instances where he had to take evasive action because of the proximity of these mysterious objects. Despite being trained as an aviation safety officer by the Navy, he felt compelled to come forward and share his story out of duty and responsibility towards his fellow pilots still facing such threats.\n\nLastly, Commander Grush provided valuable insights into the security review process for UAP information. He explained that based on Doppser's assessment, only unclassified questions could be answered in open sessions like this one. However, any classified matters would require a closed session at the appropriate level. When asked about commercial pilots reporting sightings of UAPs, he confirmed that they too have seen them but with less range and sensors compared to military aircraft.\n\nWhen questioned further about the most vivid sighting involving cube-like objects, Mr. Graves described how two fighter jets flew within 50 feet of one such object near midair - right at the entrance to their working area along the eastern seaboard. This close encounter left both pilots stunned and confused due to the lack of visible propulsion systems or other identifiable features on the object.\n\nIn response to another question regarding why he came forward on this issue, Mr. Garrosh stated that it was primarily because he wanted to help his colleagues who were still flying and dealing with these mysterious aerial phenomena. As an aviation safety officer trained by the Navy, he felt compelled to share his experiences out of duty and responsibility towards those facing similar threats.\n\nCommander Grush also shared his reasons for coming forward: after being pestered multiple times by a friend, he eventually agreed to do so as \"the one person [they] can't discredit\" and would add credibility to The New York Times article. He emphasized that this town isn't made up entirely of people like them but rather individuals who keep this issue alive despite criticism and derogatory remarks.\n\nThe witnesses expressed gratitude for the public's support in keeping this topic alive and encouraged everyone watching to continue reporting UAP sightings if possible. They acknowledged that there are currently limited options available for every man to report their encounters directly; however, they urge citizens not to lose hope and continue seeking answers through various channels such as social media platforms or contacting local authorities when appropriate."
