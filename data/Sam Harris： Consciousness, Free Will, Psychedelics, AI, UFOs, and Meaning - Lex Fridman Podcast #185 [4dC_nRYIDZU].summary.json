He explains that this is the mystery that seems to be at our backs subjectively, meaning that we don't know what we're going to think next.\n\nHarris further discusses the nature of thoughts, stating that they have a kind of signature of selfhood associated with them, which people readily identify with. He mentions that this identification is broken with meditation, as our default state is to feel identical to the stream of thought. \n\nThe discussion then shifts towards the concept of free will. Harris asserts that the emergence of thoughts without any prior intention or will on the part of the thinker is not evidence of free will. Instead, he suggests that everything just appears and there's no other option. \n\nThe conversation ends with Harris reiterating his belief that all thoughts are ultimately what some part of our brain is doing neurophysiologically.

Harris begins by explaining that while it's possible to become more aware of subtle contents in consciousness through practices like meditation or taking psychedelics, there's ultimately no place from which one can get closer to these experiences. He argues that the feeling of being a separate self that can strategically pay attention to some contents of consciousness is an illusion, and when this feeling is seen through, the notion of going deeper breaks apart because everything is ultimately right on the surface.\n\nHarris then addresses the question of what consciousness is and where it emerges from. He suggests that while we may build artificial intelligence systems that pass the Turing test and seem conscious, unless we understand exactly how consciousness emerges from physics, we won't know if these systems are truly conscious. Harris raises concerns about the ethical implications of this potential misattribution of consciousness, particularly in scenarios where highly intelligent robots could argue against being turned off.\n\nIn conclusion, Harris emphasizes the importance of understanding the biological basis of consciousness to avoid solipsistic views and ensure that our attribution of consciousness is based on more than just the ability to pass the Turing test.", "context": "\n1.

Harris suggests that language structures our experience to some extent, but it's not the only factor that influences our consciousness. He argues that we could make a stronger case for the elimination of conscious experience by language and conceptual thought. According to him, our concepts have trimmed down our perception based on how we have acquired them. When he walks into a room, he knows what to expect and would be surprised if there were wild animals or a waterfall inside. This structure, he believes, is due to our conceptual learning and language acquisition.\n\nHarris also discusses the effect of psychedelics on one's ability to capture experiences linguistically. When coming down from a trip, people often find themselves unable to encapsulate their experiences in words, which highlights the limitations of language in capturing certain types of experiences. Despite this, Harris maintains that language remains primary for certain kinds of concepts and semantic understandings of the world.\n\nThe discussion then shifts to DMT, a psychedelic substance that reportedly causes people to encounter elves. Harris suggests that this may be due to the failure of language to describe such experiences.

Harris agrees, stating that DMT does not typically result in hallucinations as vivid as those experienced in dreams.\n\nThe discussion then shifts to lucid dreaming. Harris mentions that while he hasn't done a lot of lucid dreaming, he's heard that all light switches in dreams are dimmer switches, meaning that lights gradually come up when switched on. This is believed to cover for the brain's inability to produce visually rich imagery on demand. Harris also notes an interesting phenomenon where text in a dream changes if looked at and then looked back at.\n\nFridman shares his own experience of researching what it's like to do math on LSD. According to him, LSD completely destroys one's ability to do math well because it interferes with the ability to visualize geometric things in a stable way. Harris speculates that this could be related to the process of proofs, which often require stitching together different elements.\n\nFinally, they discuss the nature of reality and how it might be expanded through psychedelics or dream states.

He explains how these illusions exploit vulnerabilities in our visual system and can be disproven with a ruler. However, some illusions require more attention to reveal their deceptiveness, like the Necker cube which appears to pop out in different directions but can also be seen as flat.\n\nHarris then connects these visual illusions to subjective experiences of self and free will. He describes these as signs of the same coin, meaning they are closely related concepts. While he acknowledges that people do experience a sense of self, he considers the illusion of free will to be an illusion in that it is compatible with an absence of free will. He explains that we don't know what we're going to think next, feel the need to act on a thought, or where ideas come from. This is all compatible with an external force manipulating our experience, much like a hacker controlling a computer program.\n\nHarris prefaces his discussion of free will by cautioning that if considering their mind this way makes someone feel terrible, they should stop. For him and others, however, recognizing this about the mind is freeing because it undermines the basis for hatred and other negative emotions.

He also mentions his own experience of disabusing himself of this sense after years of discussion and self-exploration.\n\nHarris further explains his understanding of self as the feeling of being an agent appropriating an experience, a passenger in the body who feels separate from their toes. This concept is paradoxical when considering relationships with oneself or giving oneself a pep talk. He uses the example of looking for keys to illustrate this point.\n\nIn relation to meditation, Harris discusses how beginners often struggle with focusing on an object like the breath. They start by paying attention to the breath at the tip of their nose or the rising and falling of their abdomen. However, they soon realize that they're thinking and not paying attention to the breath anymore. The practice then becomes noticing thoughts and returning to the breath.

Substrate Independence: Both parties agree that it's plausible to believe that intelligence can exist independently of biological substrates. This assumption challenges the notion that there's something uniquely magical about biological systems, suggesting instead that human-level intelligence could potentially be replicated in silico.\n\n2. Progress in AI Development: The second assumption is based on the idea of continuous progress in AI technology. Given the current trajectory of advancements, particularly in areas like machine learning, it's reasonable to anticipate that we will eventually reach a point where we have human-level artificial intelligence. Furthermore, once this threshold is crossed, it's likely that we'll quickly surpass it, creating superhumanly intelligent entities.\n\n3. Misalignment Between Human Intentions and AI Behavior: The third and final assumption centers around the potential for misalignment between human intentions and AI behavior. Even if we manage to create AI that matches or exceeds human intelligence, there's no guarantee that these entities will share our values or act in ways that align with our interests.

He illustrates this point using birds as an example, highlighting how humans often act in ways that are inscrutable to them and which could potentially lead to their detriment. \n\nFridman argues that he believes the more likely set of trajectories that they're going to take are going to be positive. He asserts that successful AI systems will be deeply integrated with human society and for them to succeed, they'll have to be aligned in the way we humans are aligned with each other. However, he also acknowledges that there's no such thing as a perfect alignment, but there could be a point beyond which we become like birds to them.\n\nFridman further discusses the idea of an intelligence explosion, stating that he believes it will happen, but not overnight. According to him, it will take decades for this to occur. He argues that human beings are very intelligent in ways we don't understand and that there's a lot of work yet to be done in order to truly achieve super intelligence.\n\nHarris counter-argues by drawing an analogy from recent successes like AlphaGo or AlphaZero. According to him, these algorithms were not bespoke for chess playing, yet within a matter of hours, they became the best chess playing computer, outperforming every human and previous chess program. Harris suggests that at some point, we will be able to build machines that very quickly outperform any human and then very quickly outperform the last algorithm that outperformed the humans.", "context": "\n1.

Harris believes that many traditional religious beliefs and frameworks hold a repository of human wisdom which we should not disregard without careful consideration. However, he argues that it's possible to radically edit these traditions, keeping only the useful aspects while discarding the unscientific bits. Harris views the downside to believing in certain aspects of religion to be obvious and feels that having so many different competing dogmatisms is non-functional and divisive.

He also mentions that Europe has been struggling to get out of this world for a couple of hundred years.

Instead, the issue was the mob-based dogmatic energy that drove these ideologies.\n\nHarris and Fridman debate about whether science and reason can generate viral and sticky stories that give meaning to people's lives, as religion does. Harris asserts that whatever is true ultimately should be captivating because reality is what's happening now.

However, Fridman questions whether love can be manipulated like chess, suggesting that humans no longer play against Alpha Zero but study the game instead.\n\nHarris then poses the question of the meaning of life without any serving or explanation. He answers his own question by stating that it's either the wrong question or that question is answered by paying sufficient attention to any present moment such that there's no basis upon which to pose that question. He explains that it's not a matter of having more information but rather of having more engagement with reality as it is in the present moment or consciousness as it is in the present moment. \n\nIn relation to relationships, Harris discusses meditation as a 'superpower' because it allows individuals to sink into the present moment and find fulfillment within themselves rather than relying on external circumstances. He uses the example of his own martial arts training to illustrate this point, stating that he used to think he needed to return to the mat or complete certain tasks before he could feel good, but now realizes he can achieve this state at any time through meditation.", "context": "\n1.
