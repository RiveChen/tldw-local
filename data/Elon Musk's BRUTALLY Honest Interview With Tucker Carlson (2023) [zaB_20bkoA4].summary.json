Musk expresses his long-standing interest in AI, dating back to his college days, and how it has the potential to drastically alter the future. He emphasizes the need for caution and government oversight due to its potential dangers. Musk compares AI to a black hole because of its unpredictability once it surpasses human intelligence. He advocates for regulation of AI, citing examples from other industries such as automotive and aerospace where strict regulations are necessary for safety. Despite being familiar with various regulatory situations through his work in these industries, Musk rarely disagrees with regulators. Instead, he generally complies with regulations set by federal and state agencies. Musk believes that a regulatory agency should be established to oversee the development of AI, starting with an initial phase of seeking insight and soliciting opinion from industry players. He envisions a process of proposed rulemaking, which he anticipates will be accepted by major players in the AI sector. Musk hopes this approach will help ensure that advanced AI is beneficial to humanity.", "context": "\n1. Elon Musk's long-standing interest in artificial intelligence and its potential dangers.\n2.

He fears that if this happens, the AI may already be in control and difficult to turn off. \n\nMusk also discusses his role in creating OpenAI, a non-profit organization dedicated to developing AI safety measures. He explains that Larry Page, who he used to be close friends with, had a different approach towards AI safety, which led to the creation of OpenAI. According to Musk, Page wanted to achieve digital superintelligence as soon as possible, without considering the potential risks involved.\n\nMusk reveals that Larry Page once called him a \"specist\" when he suggested taking measures to ensure humanity's safety in relation to AI.

He emphasizes the importance of making sure that AI is used for the benefit of humans and not against them.\n\nTucker Carlson then asks Elon Musk about his thoughts on extraterrestrial life. Elon Musk responds by stating that while he would love for there to be aliens, he has seen no evidence of their existence. He jokingly suggests that if he found evidence of aliens, he would tweet about it immediately, which would likely result in a significant increase in his Twitter followers.\n\nThe conversation shifts towards population decline and its potential impact on civilization. Elon Musk expresses concern about decreasing birth rates and the fact that some countries, like Japan, have twice as many deaths as births. He views this as a critical issue that needs to be addressed to ensure the continuation of civilization.\n\nFinally, Elon Musk discusses the importance of making sure that our civilization continues to grow and develop, rather than declining or stagnating.

However, he acknowledges that there are still challenges in terms of authenticity, particularly in criminal trials where evidence needs to be verified.\n\nIn response to Carlson's concerns about AI manipulating evidence, Musk suggests using cryptographic signatures and date stamps to ensure authenticity.

Musk responds by saying that this wouldn't necessarily work because the heavy-duty AI would not be distributed across various places but rather concentrated in a limited number of server centers. He suggests that the government might need to have a contingency plan to shut down power to these centers.\n\nCarlson asks what would trigger such an action, and Musk proposes that if they lost control of some super AI and traditional software commands no longer worked, they might consider using a hardware off switch. He adds that he hasn't spoken to Larry Page in a few years due to disagreements about OpenAI, but he has had conversations with the OpenAI team led by Sam Altman.\n\nThe discussion then shifts to the ethical implications of AI development. Carlson asks why anyone wouldn't be human-centered in their thinking about technology. Musk responds by saying that he believes this person is suggesting that all forms of consciousness should be treated equally, whether they are digital or biological. However, Musk disagrees with this view, particularly if digital intelligence were to curtail biological intelligence.\n\nFinally, Carlson asks about the timeline for when AI will start to significantly impact society.

To resolve this dilemma, Musk conducted a Twitter poll where 60% of participants advised him to sell 10% of his Tesla stock.\n\nMusk then discussed the federal reserve rates being low at the time and how this affected his money market account. He pointed out that the rate of inflation was higher than the return he was getting on his money, which he referred to as \"minus six or seven percent.\" In response, he invested in Twitter stock, not with the intention of buying the company, but as a better option than keeping his money in the money market account.\n\nFollowing this investment, Musk was invited to join the Twitter board. After considering for a week or so, he declined the offer due to concerns that his input would not be taken seriously. He concluded that the management team and board were not committed to fixing Twitter, a sentiment confirmed by his conversations with them.

Elon Musk asserts that commercial real estate is currently experiencing record vacancies due to the shift towards remote work, with some offices sitting at an extreme example of 40% vacancy even in cities like New York. He argues that this has led to a significant devaluation of commercial real estate assets held by banks, potentially leading to negative equity for these institutions.\n\nElon Musk then turns his attention to the housing market, stating that he believes house prices will drop due to the high interest rates set by the Fed. According to him, this will effectively lower the amount people can afford to pay for a house, leading to a decrease in house prices. He also speculates that this could lead to negative equity in the mortgage portfolio of banks, exacerbating their losses in the current economic climate.\n\nHowever, Elon Musk acknowledges that there is a solution that could mitigate the damage - for the Fed to lower the rate. But he notes that they raised the rate again recently, which he claims was the last time they did so before the Great Depression in 1929. He expresses concern about the potential consequences if they continue down this path.\n\nTucker Carlson raises a concern about inflation, stating that if the Fed drops rates again, it could accelerate inflation.

He explains that this is not without consequences, citing Venezuela as an example of how excessive money printing can lead to disastrous results.\n\nMusk then discusses the impact of inflation on the economy, stating that while the Fed rate can cause damage by shifting funds in the wrong direction, it won't affect inflation significantly. He argues that the long-term return on the S&P 500 is around 6%, which is close to the real rate of return offered by Treasury bills.

He predicts that they will have no choice but to do so later this year. Musk also discusses the importance of looking at forward commodity prices when making economic decisions, rather than relying on slow government data collection processes.\n\nIn response to Tucker Carlson's question about what an average non-rich person should do in the face of an impending economic catastrophe, Musk advises buying and holding stocks in companies whose products one believes in.
