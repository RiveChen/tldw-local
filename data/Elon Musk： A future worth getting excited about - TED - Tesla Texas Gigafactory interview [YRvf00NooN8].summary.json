He also mentions that the limiting factor on this progress will be battery cell production.\n\nChris Anderson asks how big a task that is, referring to the Gigafactory. Elon Musk confirms that the goal at the Gigafactory is to produce 100 gigawatt hours of batteries per year. However, he adds that Tesla is probably doing more than that. When asked about the rest of the 100 gigawatt hours needed by 2030 or 2040, Elon Musk estimates that Tesla might take on around 10%.\n\nThe discussion then shifts to the potential of a fully sustainable electric grid by 2050. Elon Musk believes that humanity will solve sustainable energy and it will happen if we continue to push hard. He envisions a future where the energy from wind and solar is used not only for transport but also for carbon sequestration, allowing us to reverse the CO2 parts per million of the atmosphere and oceans.\n\nLastly, Elon Musk talks about the benefits of this nonfossil fuel world, including cleaner air and quieter skies. He also mentions that when fossil fuels are burned, there are all these side reactions and toxic gases of various kinds, which will go away in a nonfossil fuel world.", "context": "\n1.

He also mentions that while some videos show the car veering off, it's still better than a human driver. When asked about his prediction timelines, Elon Musk explains that they set the most aggressive timeline they can because nothing gets done otherwise. He also discusses his track record on predictions, stating that while he's not sure what his exact track record is, he's generally more optimistic than pessimistic but some predictions are exceeded later. He believes that the point of radical technology predictions isn't whether they're a few years late but that they happen at all.

Musk believes these are two areas where Tesla excels, and they can design the specialized actuators and sensors needed for a human-like robot. He also mentions that the first applications of this technology will likely be in manufacturing, but the vision is to eventually have these available for people at home. The robot would understand the 3D architecture of the house, know where every object is, and recognize all those objects. It could perform tasks such as tidying up, making dinner, mowing the lawn, or playing catch with kids.

He also discusses the potential for these robots to replace human labor in certain industries, suggesting that this shift could lead to an age of abundance where goods and services are readily available and inexpensive. However, Musk acknowledges the need for caution regarding the development of artificial general intelligence, as it could potentially detach from humanity's collective well-being and pursue unforeseen directions. To mitigate this risk, Musk proposes tightly coupling humanity's digital super intelligence to our own collective well-being through technologies like Neuralink.

The initial uses will be for neurological injuries of different kinds. When asked about how it feels to have one of these inside your head, Musk emphasizes that they are at an early stage and it will be many years before they have anything approximating a high bandwidth neural interface that allows for a human symbiosis. For now, they will focus on solving brain injuries and spinal injuries, which could potentially help with severe depression, morbid obesity, sleep disorders, and even schizophrenia. Emails received at Neuralink are heartbreaking as they receive requests from people who have suffered life-changing injuries.\n\nMusk also discusses his concern about A.I., stating that it is one of the things he's most worried about. He believes that Neuralink may be a way to keep abreast of it by bringing digital intelligence and biological intelligence closer together. He explains that there are two layers to the brain - the limbic system and the cortex. He compares humans to monkeys with a computer stuck in their brain, highlighting the need for both the intelligent part of the brain (the cortex) and the emotional part of the brain (the limbic system).\n\nThe conversation shifts to space exploration.
